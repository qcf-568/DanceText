# DanceText
This is the official repository of the CVPR2026 paper Detect Any AI-Counterfeited Text Image.

The DanceText dataset will be publicly available within 1-2 months. Due to its substantial size (~1TB), the release requires review by the company's legal department, and the upload process is subject to bandwidth limitations. 

The ArXiv paper will be available upon the dataset's release.

The DS-Net model code will be available before conference.
